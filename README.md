# CSS Hora de Codar - Sneakers Sales Website

This is a simple website coded with only HTML and CSS.

It's is my personal version of the [original project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwbegraDXD8) from the YouTube channel [Matheus Battisti - Hora de Codar](https://www.youtube.com/@MatheusBattisti).

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

### What I learned

- How to fork a repository on GitHub.
- Tag class shortcut.
  >`tag.classname#idname` + `tab`
- Change occurences on siblings.
  >`cmd` + `d`
- How to use a CSS reset.
  >```css
  >* {
  >  padding: 0;
  >  margin: 0;
  >  box-sizing: border-box;
  >  font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;
  >}
  >```
- The css property `transition`.

### Continued development

- Concepts I'm still not completely comfortable with:
  - The css property and value `box-sizing: border-box`.

- Techniques I want to refine and perfect:
  -  CSS Box Model.

### Useful resources
